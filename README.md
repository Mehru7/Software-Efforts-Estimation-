# Software-Efforts-Estimation-
Analysis of Software Efforts Estimation using Machine Learning 

Worried about accurately estimating project effort? This repository houses five datasets and explores the impact of feature selection on machine learning models for better software effort estimation.

High-dimensional datasets may present space constraints and require significant computational effort, leading to lower classification accuracies. Therefore, an efficient selection procedure for representative characteristics is necessary. 

This repo is here to help! We've got:

5 different datasets like NASA93 and COCOMO, covering all sorts of projects. ‚Äç

Secret weapons called "features" that help predict project time better.

Machine learning magic to turn those features into super-accurate estimates.

The result? No more guessing games!  You can plan your projects and resources with confidence.
