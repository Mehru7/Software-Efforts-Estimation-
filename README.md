# Software-Efforts-Estimation-
Analysis of Software Efforts Estimation using Machine Learning 

Worried about accurately estimating project effort? This repository houses five datasets and explores the impact of feature selection on machine learning models for better software effort estimation.

Download and use these datasets for your research or projects.

This repo is here to help! We've got:

5 different datasets like NASA93 and COCOMO, covering all sorts of projects. ‚Äç
Secret weapons called "features" that help predict project time better.
Machine learning magic to turn those features into super-accurate estimates.
The result? No more guessing games!  You can plan your projects and resources with confidence.

What you can do:

Download the datasets: They're free (except ISBSG, which needs a little $$).
